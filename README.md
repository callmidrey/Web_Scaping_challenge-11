# Web_Scaping_challenge-11
This Challenge was very intresting and insightful as "Beautiful Soup" was employed in finding specific information on the website.
The Challenge consisted of two main parts:
# - Part 1 : Scraping Tiles ans Preview Text from Mars News
This part produced very interesting insights such as the titles of the articles published on the website and there was a lot of them.

# - Part 2 : Scrapping and Analyzing Mars Weather Data
This part also utilized Beautiful Soup object to scape the data in HTML table, which is very interesting, assembled the scaped data into a Pandas Dataframe, examined the data types and converted those that needed to be altered to make analysis easier.
The data obtained was analyzed to answer the following questions:
1. How many months exist on Mars?
2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?

Insightfully, the Analysis produced the following results:

A suggestion can be made that :
- On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the warmest. But it is always very cold there in human terms!

- Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth.

- The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
